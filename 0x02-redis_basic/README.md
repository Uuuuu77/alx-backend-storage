# Redis Basics

Redis is an in-memory data structure store widely used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, and sets. To get started with Redis, install it using a package manager (`sudo apt install redis-server` for Ubuntu or `brew install redis` for macOS) and start the server with `redis-server`. Basic operations include setting and getting string values (`SET mykey "value"` and `GET mykey`), working with counters (`INCR` and `DECR`), managing lists (`LPUSH` and `LRANGE`), and handling hashes (`HSET` and `HGET`). Redis is also commonly used for caching data to improve application performance. For example, in Python, you can use the `redis-py` library to connect to Redis, store data with an expiration time using `setex`, and retrieve cached data to reduce database load. For more details, refer to the [official Redis documentation](https://redis.io/documentation).
